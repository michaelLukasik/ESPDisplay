Libraries used:

Arduino_GFX_Library.h -> Standard library provided by arduino, provides SPI integration with OLED TFT Screen. Faster than other libraries tried, however a color bitmap draw function not available...

ELMduino.h -> Library created by PowerBroker2 to query the vehicle's CAN bus and ask for PID's https://github.com/PowerBroker2/ELMduino. 

BluetoothSerial.h -> Standard library again for providing BT protocal between ELM device and ESP32. This could be changed to to a more standard UART wired connection which may or may not help with the PID misses. I don't have a wired ELM device to test this on however, plus more wires coming from that part of the car might not be incredibly safe...
